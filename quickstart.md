# Quickstart (have GRR running in 5 minutes)

This page describes how to get GRR clients and server components up and
running for the first time. If you have Docker installed, and just want to
experiment with a container that already has GRR set up, you can follow
the instructions given [here](installing-and-running-grr/via-docker.md). It takes
~2 minutes to download the image and initialize the server. Or to quickly start
all components and have a full demo setup running follow the instructions
[here](installing-and-running-grr/via-docker-compose.md)

On successful start of the Docker Compose stack, you should have an admin
interface running on port 8000 by default. One Docker container runs the
GRR client which can already be used.
