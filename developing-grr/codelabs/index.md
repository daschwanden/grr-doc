# GRR Codelabs

[Codelabs](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools) are interactive instructional tutorials, which can be authored in markdown syntax (or Google Docs) using some simple formatting conventions.
This doc contains the documentation and instructions youâ€™ll need for building and publishing the GRR codelabs (and creating your own in case you choose to do so).

If you're interested in authoring codelabs, create a markdown file (or a Google Doc) following the [Codelab Formatting Guide](FORMAT-GUIDE.md) and see the online [documentation page](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/blob/main/claat/README.md) on how to use the [```claat```](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/blob/main/claat/README.md) command line tool.

Also, consider joining the [codelab-authors Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codelab-authors), which connects you with other authors and provides updates on new releases.

## Available GRR Codelabs

The currently available Codelabs are the following:
- [How to add a Client Action](./how-to-add-a-client-action.md), and
- [How to add a Flow](./how-to-add-a-flow.md)

## Building the GRR Codelabs

Run the ```claat``` command line tool to transform the markdown content in the Codelabs into one of the supported output formats. The default supported format is HTML. The ```claat``` tool also supports additional formats, see the [```claat``` documentation](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/blob/main/claat/README.md) for more details.

```
claat export how-to-add-a-client-action.md
# The output should look like the below:
#      ok      how-to-add-a-client-action

claat export how-to-add-a-flow.md
# The output should look like the below:
#      ok      how-to-add-a-flow
```

This will create the subdirectories with a static HTML page for each of the Codelabs.

```
ls -la how-to-add-a-client-action
# The output should look like the below:
# codelab.json
# img
# index.html

ls -la how-to-add-a-flow
# The output should look like the below:
# codelab.json
# img
# index.html
```

If you're interested in altering the Codelabs then follow the instructions in the [Codelab Formatting Guide](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/blob/main/FORMAT-GUIDE.md).

## Serving and accessing the GRR Codelabs

You can serve the exported Codelabs on any webserver.

However, for your convenience the ```claat``` tool also ships with a simple webserver to get you started.
Use the command below to serve the GRR Codelabs.

```
claat serve
# The output should look like the below:
# Serving codelabs on localhost:9090, opening browser tab now...
```

You can now access the Codelabs by pointing your browser to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

Pointing your browser to [http://localhost:9090/how-to-add-a-client-action/index.html](http://localhost:9090/how-to-add-a-client-action/index.html) should load the Client Action codelab depicted below.

When pointing your browser to [http://localhost:9090/how-to-add-a-flow/index.html](http://localhost:9090/how-to-add-a-flow/index.html) you should see the Flow codelab depicted below.
